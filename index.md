I try to draw something in my spare time. After posting 50+ pieces on social media (my Instagram: [gniquyij](https://www.instagram.com/gniquyij/)), a question came to mind:
- How could I protect my work from piracy?

You might notice I've already added my signature in each drawing but it:
- might block the view
- is easy to be removed
- ...

One of my friends introduced 'blind watermark' to me. Tried and it helped a lot. Share with you here.

So what is 'blind watermark'? As the name suggests, invisible watermark to some extent. 
If you search 'blind watermark', you would get a lot of ways to do that. What I did is to add my watermark to the frequency-domain of my drawings - that's why I said 'invisible to some extent'.
